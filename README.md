Here are all my Practicums for my **Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems** class, 
taken in Spring 2023 with Dr. Patrick Martin!

These were completed using Google Colab. I have them saved here for future reference.
I downloaded them in both the *notebook* format and the *python* format and placed
them in their respective directories. No, I don't know why the *notebook* format
was saved in Pascal Case while the *python* format was saved in all lowercase.
